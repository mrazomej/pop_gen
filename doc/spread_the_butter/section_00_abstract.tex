With the fusion of Darwin's insights into evolution and Mendel's mechanistic
understanding of the rules of heredity came the Modern Synthesis--a beautiful
theoretical framework for how to mathematically think about ``biology's greatest
idea.'' The sequencing revolution in biology has made it possible to investigate
the genetic composition of natural or laboratory populations, finally allowing
us to test the predictions made more than half a century ago by the founders of
population genetics. Now, more than ever, a deep understanding of the
mathematical theory of evolution can give us deep insights into basic and
applied problems. Here we therefore present an intuitive and pedagogical
introduction into population genetics diffusion theory. We derive Kimura's
diffusion-advection equation for allele frequencies from different perspectives,
including discrete master-equation approaches, and Langevin equations.
\mrm{This is definitely a rough first draft}
